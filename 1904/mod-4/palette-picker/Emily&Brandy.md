 ## Completion

 #### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

We were able to complete the base functionality aside from locking the palettes and preventing duplicate names.

 #### Link to an image of your wireframe(s)
- On GitHub FE repository

 #### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/BrandyMello/color-palette-fe1/blob/master/src/Projects/Projects.js)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- We were proud of the code in our Projects component because it felt like we were able to accomplish a lot. By re-routing to a specific project it allowed the deleting of projects and palettes to be more user friendly and intuitive. We also utilized contentEditable when updating the palette and project names which also establishes an ease to this functionality.The projects also stayed correctly even after renaming a palette so that was exciting

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/BrandyMello/color-palette-fe1/blob/master/src/App.js)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- Our App component ended up feeling very heavy after all was said and done. I think that we realized too late that we should have implemented redux to keep our components clean and tidy. We also could have set up a better structure in terms of our front-end app. At times our components felt a little overwhelming and the passing of props was an issue at points.

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 -We didn't really look at any specific design examples, we based the layout off of our wireframes and went with that design. Our wireframe was inspired by the example in the project template.

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- It was definitely more straight forward than FE testing but we still encountered some hiccups wit it. Ultimately we got all of the BE testing completed
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- It seems really straight forward and helpful but we are still encountering issues with TravisCI on the frontend. It's having issues with our jest package that allows up to create snapshot tests. Couldn't find a solution.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- It was interesting to be able to see how the frontend and backend applications could be hooked up to work together. Definitely gave us a new perspective on what we have been creating thus far.
